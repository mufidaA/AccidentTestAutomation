# AccidentTestAutomation - An Attempt at Scraping and Form Filling Automation

Greetings, fellow adventurers in the world of automated web testing! ü§ñüåê

## Overview
Are you just like me tired of mundane, Daily applying and endless forms to fill? Have you ever dreamt of teaching computer to surf the internet and apply jobs while you have yoga or play video games? Look no further! Behold, that was my ambisious attempt **AccidentTestAutomation**, a testament to my six hours of glorious tinkering and the promise of more curious weeks to come. üïíü§î

## Project Contents

### Script 1 - The Web Scrape Marvel

In this act, I harnessed the powers of the mighty BeautifulSoup and Selenium to venture into the wilds of the internet. Armed with a Chrome driver, I embarked on a journey to a mysterious URL (which, by the way, you must provide!). After a brief moment of contemplation (a 5-second nap), I summoned the magical BeautifulSoup to extract job positions and links from the HTML wilderness. The outcome? A grand list of job titles and their corresponding links, all neatly tucked into a JSON scroll.

### Script 2 - The Form-Filling Follies

With the JSON scroll in hand, I embarked on a quest to automate the art of form filling. Armed with Selenium's WebDriverWait and a resolute mindset, I navigated through the JSON scroll, picking the first job's link like a true digital adventurer (maybe all the links later). Upon reaching the job page, I even tamed the Cookie Consent Monster (if it dared to appear), before elegantly filling in the first name, last name, email, phone number, and attaching a heroic resume. To sprinkle some gender diversity, I checked the "Female" checkbox, because why not? The browser, ever obedient, lingered in suspense until I pressed the fateful "Enter" key.

## The Unfinished Symphony

I stand here before you, weary yet thrilled, to declare that this project is but a fraction of the future triumphs that await. I plan to pour more hours, weeks perhaps, into refining and expanding. As the code evolves, so shall the saga.

## Call to Fellow Adventurers

Fellow wanderers of the digital expanse, I invite you to join me. Clone this repository, tweak the scripts, face the bizarre challenges that come with web automation, and let's explore uncharted territories together. But beware, for web pages change like the wind, and our scripts must evolve with them.

## Concluding Notes

And so, my dear readers, I present to you the **AccidentTestAutomation** project. May this document serve as a testament to my six-hour odyssey, with the promise of more intriguing weeks to come. The code and this repository's tale shall evolve, and who knows what comedic marvels and functional feats lie ahead.
